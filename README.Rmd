Get data from the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/) in a [tidy](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html) [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org). 

## Installation
Install from CRAN using:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readrba")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:
```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mattcowgill/readrba")
```

## Examples
```{r library, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readrba)
```

### Quick examples
With a few lines of code, you can get a data series from the RBA and visualise it.
Here's the unemployment rate:
```{r}
unemp_rate <- read_rba(series_id = "GLFSURSA") 

unemp_rate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Unemployment rate (actual)")
```

And you can also easily get the RBA's public forecasts - from 1990 to present -
and visualise those. Here's every public forecast of the unemployment rate the
RBA has made over the past three decades:

```{r}
unemp_forecasts <- rba_forecasts() %>%
  filter(series == "unemp_rate")


unemp_forecasts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = value, 
             group = forecast_date, 
             col = forecast_date)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Unemployment rate (RBA forecasts)")
```


### Reading RBA data
There primary function in {readrba} is `read_rba()`.

Here's how you fetch the current version of a single RBA statistical table: table G1, consumer price inflation using `read_rba()`:

```{r}
cpi_table <- read_rba(table_no = "g1")
```

The object returned by `read_rba()` is a tidy tibble (ie. in 'long' format):

```{r}
head(cpi_table)
```

You can also request multiple tables. They'll be returned together as one tidy tibble:

```{r}
rba_data <- read_rba(table_no = c("a1", "g1"))

head(rba_data)

unique(rba_data$table_title)
```

You can also retrieve data based on the unique RBA time series identifier(s). For example, to getch the consumer price index series only:
```{r}
cpi_series <- read_rba(series_id = "GCPIAG")
head(cpi_series)
unique(cpi_series$series_id)
```

The convenience function `read_rba_seriesid()` is a wrapper around `read_rba()`. This means `read_rba_seriesid("GCPIAG")` is equivalent to `read_rba(series_id = "GCPIAG")`.

By default, `read_rba()` fetches the current version of whatever table you request. You can specify the historical version of a table, if it's available, using the `cur_hist` argument:

```{r hist}

hist_a11 <- read_rba(table_no = "a1.1", cur_hist = "historical")

head(hist_a11)
```

### Browsing RBA data
Two functions are provided to help you find the table number or series ID you need. These are `browse_rba_tables()` and `browse_rba_series()`. Each returns a tibble with information about the available RBA data. 

```{r browse}
browse_rba_tables()
```
```{r browse_series}
browse_rba_series()
```

You can specify a search string to filter the tables or series, as in:
```{r browse-search}
browse_rba_tables("inflation")
```

### RBA forecasts
The function `rba_forecasts()` provides easy access to all the RBA's public
forecasts of key economic variables since 1990. The function scrapes the 
RBA website to obtain the latest Statement on Monetary Policy forecasts.

```{r forecasts}
rba_forecasts()
```

If you just want the latest forecasts, you can request them:
```{r latest-forecasts}
rba_forecasts(all_or_latest = "latest")
```

## Data availability

The `read_rba()` function is able to import most tables on the [Statistical Tables](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/) page of the RBA website. These are the tables that are downloaded when you use `read_rba(cur_hist = "current")`, the default. 

`read_rba()` can also download many of the tables on the [Historical Data](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/historical-data.html) page of the RBA website. To get these, specify `cur_hist = "historical"` in `read_rba()`. 

### Historical exchange rate tables
The historical exchange rate tables do not have table numbers on the RBA website. They can still be downloaded, using the following table numbers:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ex_rates <- dplyr::filter(readrba:::table_list, grepl("ex", no)) 

ex_rates <- dplyr::select(ex_rates, `Table title` = title, `table_no` = no)

knitr::kable(ex_rates)
```

### Non-standard tables
`read_rba()` is currently only able to import RBA statistical tables that are formatted in a (more or less) standard way. Some are formatted in a non-standard way, either because they're distributions rather than time series, or because they're particularly old. 

Tables that are **not** able to be downloaded are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
nonreadable <- dplyr::filter(readrba:::table_list, readable == FALSE)
nonreadable <- dplyr::select(nonreadable, `Table title` = title, table_no = no, current_or_historical)
knitr::kable(nonreadable )
```
