Get data from the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/) in a [tidy](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html) [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org). 

This package is still in active development. Some aspects of its functionality are incomplete.

## Installation
The package is not yet on CRAN. Install from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mattcowgill/readrba")
```

## Examples
### Reading RBA data
There is one main function in {readrba}: `read_rba()`.

Here's how you fetch the current version of a single RBA statistical table: table G1, consumer price inflation:

```{r}
cpi_table <- readrba::read_rba(table_no = "g1")
```

The object returned by `read_rba()` is a tidy tibble (ie. in 'long' format):

```{r}
head(cpi_table)
```

You can also request multiple tables. They'll be returned together as one tidy tibble:

```{r}
rba_data <- readrba::read_rba(table_no = c("a1", "g1"))

head(rba_data)

unique(rba_data$table_title)
```

You can also retrieve data based on the unique RBA time series identifier(s). For example, to getch the consumer price index series only:
```{r}
cpi_series <- readrba::read_rba(series_id = "GCPIAG")
head(cpi_series)
unique(cpi_series$series_id)
```

The convenience function `read_rba_seriesid()` is a wrapper around `read_rba()`. This means `read_rba_seriesid("GCPIAG")` is equivalent to `read_rba(series_id = "GCPIAG")`.

By default, `read_rba()` fetches the current version of whatever table you request. You can specify the historical version of a table, if it's available, using the `cur_hist` argument:

```{r hist}

hist_a11 <- readrba::read_rba(table_no = "a1.1", cur_hist = "historical")

head(hist_a11)
```

### Browsing RBA data
Two functions are provided to help you find the table number or series ID you need. These are `browse_rba_tables()` and `browse_rba_series()`. Each returns a tibble with information about the available RBA data. 

```{r browse}
readrba::browse_rba_tables()
```
```{r browse_series}
readrba::browse_rba_series()
```

You can specify a search string to filter the tables or series, as in:
```{r browse-search}
readrba::browse_rba_tables("inflation")
```


## Data availability

The `read_rba()` function is able to import most tables on the [Statistical Tables](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/) page of the RBA website. These are the tables that are downloaded when you use `read_rba(cur_hist = "current")`, the default. 

`read_rba()` can also download many of the tables on the [Historical Data](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/historical-data.html) page of the RBA website. To get these, specify `cur_hist = "historical"` in `read_rba()`. 

### Historical exchange rate tables
The historical exchange rate tables do not have table numbers on the RBA website. They can still be downloaded, using the following table numbers:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ex_rates <- dplyr::filter(readrba:::table_list, grepl("ex", no)) 

ex_rates <- dplyr::select(ex_rates, `Table title` = title, `table_no` = no)

knitr::kable(ex_rates)
```

### Non-standard tables
`read_rba()` is currently only able to import RBA statistical tables that are formatted in a (more or less) standard way. Some are formatted in a non-standard way, either because they're distributions rather than time series, or because they're particularly old. 

Tables that are **not** able to be downloaded are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
nonreadable <- dplyr::filter(readrba:::table_list, readable == FALSE)
nonreadable <- dplyr::select(nonreadable, `Table title` = title, table_no = no, current_or_historical)
knitr::kable(nonreadable )
```

## Issues and contributions

I welcome any feature requests or bug reports. The best way is to file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MattCowgill/readrba/issues). 

I would welcome contributions to the package. Please start by filing an issue, outlining the bug you intend to fix or functionality you intend to add or modify.
