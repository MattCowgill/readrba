The Reserve Bank of Australia publishes lots of useful [statistical tables on its website](https://rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/). The `readrba` package helps you:

1. Download RBA statistical tables; and
2. Import the data into R as a tidy tibble. 

You can import the data

```{r setup}
library(readrba)
```
